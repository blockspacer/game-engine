# Locate SDL library
#
# This module defines
#
# ::
#
#   SDL2_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
#   SDL2_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
#   SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
#   SDL2_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the version of SDL
#
#
#
# This module responds to the flag:
#
# ::
#
#   SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY
#     If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because
#     only applications need main().
#     Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
#     module will attempt to locate and set the proper link flags
#     as part of the returned SDL2_LIBRARIES variable.
#
#
#
# Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the
# OS X framework based version.  (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which
# this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
# module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.
#
#
#
# Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your
# configuration and no SDL2_LIBRARIES, it means CMake did not find your SDL
# library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc).  Set
# SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again.
# Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this
# value as appropriate.  These values are used to generate the final
# SDL2_LIBRARIES variable, but when these values are unset, SDL2_LIBRARIES
# does not get created.
#
#
#
# $SDL2_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
# ./configure --prefix=$SDL2_DIR used in building SDL.  l.e.galup 9-20-02
#
# Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building
# by using environmental variables and providing a more
# controlled/consistent search behavior.  Added new modifications to
# recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL
# guidelines.  Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
# platforms.  Added a search for threads which is needed by some
# platforms.  Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
#
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL2_LIBRARIES to
# override this selection or set the CMake environment
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
#
# Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
# This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
# "SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons
# because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).
